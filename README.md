# LET'S YARN APP
This app shows how real-time chats can be made possible through the use of sockets. A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. Socket enables bi-directional communcation between a server and a client without the need of a http requests. The concept of socket is that the server catches an emitted event from a socket and broadcasts the response to all sockets connected to the server.

[See documentation here](https://socket.io/docs/v4/).

# USING THE LET'S YARN CHAT APP
1. Open your browser and enter the url *http://localhost:3000*

2. Open this url ( *http://localhost:3000* ) on at least two tabs to serve up the Let's Yarn App.

3. The Let's Yarn App has two fields for **Username** and **Room**. This fields are compulsory, as the *Username* field helps to distinguish one user from another and the *Room* field makes it possible for users belonging to a common room to see their chats.

4. You can only see chats specific to the room you joined.

# See illustrations below

If you look closely at the four images you would notice that User1 and User2 belong to the **tech** room and User3 and User4 belong to the **football** room.

**User1** and **User2** can't see the chats between **User3** and **User4** likewise **User3** and **User4** can't see the chats of **User1** and **User2** because they all belong to different *rooms*.
